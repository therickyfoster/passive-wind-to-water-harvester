## Overview

**Passive Wind-to-Water Harvesters™** are **compact, energy-free devices** that **pull moisture from the air and condense it into clean water**, using only wind flow and condensation-friendly materials. Each unit can **collect 5–15 liters of potable water per day** (depending on humidity and wind speed) and store it in **underground or root-level reservoirs** to support plants, communities, or wildlife.

Designed for **mass production using low-cost materials**, these systems are intended for **rapid deployment in arid and post-disaster zones**, and can be **scaled into community networks to stabilize ecosystems**.

---

## Core Features

- **Energy-Free Operation** – Uses only natural wind and temperature gradients; no electricity required.  
- **Modular & Scalable** – Units can be connected into **local or regional water grids**.  
- **Durable & Low-Cost** – Constructed from bamboo, recycled plastics, and condensation mesh.  
- **Soil Hydration Mode** – Delivers water directly to root systems or buried cisterns.  
- **Portable & Easy to Deploy** – Lightweight (10–15 kg) and quick to assemble.

---

## How It Works

1. **Wind Capture Funnel**: Guides airflow over **hydrophilic mesh panels** with a high surface area.  
2. **Condensation Layer**: Moisture in the air condenses on the mesh as the temperature drops along the funnel.  
3. **Collection Channel**: Gravity pulls droplets into storage tanks or directly into soil.  
4. **Network Integration**: Units can link together via tubing to **feed small-scale irrigation systems**.

## Manufacturing & Scalability

- **Materials**:  
  - Bamboo or lightweight composites (for frame).  
  - Hydrophilic condensation mesh (recycled polymers or metal mesh).  
  - Bio-based or recycled plastic for funnels and tanks.

- **Production**:  
  - Can be **built by local microfactories** with basic tools.  
  - Mass-produced units cost **$40–$70 USD each** at scale.  
  - Each unit can **support 20–40 plants or 3–5 people per day** in moderate humidity zones.

- **Scalability**:  
  - Easily replicated and deployed by **communities, NGOs, or DAOs**.  
  - Blueprints designed to **fit into existing plastic/bamboo fabrication lines**.

---

## Deployment Scenarios

- **Arid & Drought-Stricken Regions** – Provides clean water without reliance on power grids.  
- **Post-Disaster Zones** – Supports temporary settlements and ecological repair.  
- **Reforestation Efforts** – Supplies **consistent moisture to young trees and crops**.  
- **Urban Applications** – Rooftop or park installations to reduce municipal water strain.  

---

## Environmental Impact

- Reduces dependence on **groundwater extraction and bottled water**.  
- Supports **ecosystem revival** in desertified or burned areas.  
- Entire lifecycle is **eco-friendly**: no fuel, minimal maintenance, and **90% recyclable materials**.  
- Each network of 1,000 units can **harvest 5,000–15,000 liters/day**, creating **local water security**.

---

## Open Collaboration & DAO Integration

This project is managed via a **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO)** to:  
- **Fund and accelerate production worldwide**.  
- Provide **local communities with open-source kits** and profit-sharing incentives.  
- Tokenize and verify **liters of water harvested and ecological impact** on-chain.

DAO members can **vote on deployments, factory launches, and future R&D directions**.

---

## Roadmap

**Phase 1 (2025 Q3)**:  
- Finalize **standardized unit design** for low-cost mass production.  
- Begin field testing in **Kenya (arid zones)** and **California (drought-impacted farmlands)**.

**Phase 2 (2025 Q4)**:  
- Deploy **50,000 units globally** via NGO and DAO partnerships.  
- Launch **open-source build guides** for local fabrication.

**Phase 3 (2026)**:  
- Establish **integrated water networks** with remote monitoring.  
- Tie water production into **global carbon/water credit marketplaces**.
